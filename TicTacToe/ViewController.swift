        * Really basic Tic-Tac-Toe game, created by NoyH, all code updated from previous versions of Xcode and Swift.
        * The story board was re-made too, this time looking cleaner than before. Won't support all device sizes, set it onlu for iPhone 6 and above.
        * iPad intergration is possible, just won't look as clean. Didn't put too much effort into making it graphical on all devices in this project, back then, there were less devices to worry about lol.
